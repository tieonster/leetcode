### Valid Parentheses
You can solve this problem using a stack data structure.  <br />
The idea is to iterate through the string and for each open bracket encountered, push it onto the stack. <br />
When a closing bracket is encountered, check whether it matches the top of the stack. <br />
If it does, pop the top of the stack. If it doesn't match or the stack is empty, the string is not valid. <br />
